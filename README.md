# Dashboard-using-Microsoft-Excel
Excited to share my very first project: 'Annual Sales Performance Dashboard: Gaining Insights into Store Revenue and Growth,' created using Microsoft Excel.

Objective: Vrinda Store aimed to create an annual sales report for 2022 to gain a comprehensive understanding of their customers and enhance sales growth in 2023.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization. After developing the dashboard, several key conclusions were drawn:

Women are more inclined to make purchases compared to men (approximately 65%).
The top three contributing states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh (approximately 35% combined).
The most significant contributor in terms of age group is adults aged 30-49 (about 50%).
The primary sales channels driving revenue are Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra (around 80%).
In conclusion, to enhance sales for Vrinda Store, the focus should be on targeting women customers within the 30-49 age group residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Utilizing ads, offers, and coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra could prove effective.
